       • Servlet Collaboration
          o We have two ways to collaborate with our servlet:
               1.  RequestDispatcher
                  • It is for receiving the request of the object that defines it and the send 
                  that request to a resource such as Html, Servlet or JSP file.
                  • In RequestDispatcher we have use two method to define its interface.
                      • forward() method – from the term forward, it is a method that forward 
                      the request of a servlet to a resource on the side of the server.
                      • include() method – include the entire resource such as Html, servlet
                       or JSP file in response.
                2.  sendRedirect() method
                      • This method is use to locate another resource and implement there our response.
        • Servlet Lifecycle
            o Instantiation => constructor call
                  - creates a service for the client request.
            o Initialization => init() method
                  - this method is invoked only once and the servlet  will get to be initialized.
            o Request handling => service() method
                  - service method is called for every service request that is received. 
                  It performs the needed logical processes to be able to allow a request 
                  to be sent and be given a response.
            o Destruction=> destroy() method
                   - destroy method is called before a servlet is removed. 

        • Servlet – Error Handling
          o Use to able to control the error that will be appearing in the Web client.
          o We can use the syntax <error-page/> elements.
          o Different <error-page/> element.
              1.  <error-code>
                  • It is optional and used as a valid error code.
              2.  <exception-type>
                  • It is optional and use just like java exception type as an exception in HTTP.
              3.  <location>
                  • Use to redirect our page to a resource whenever our page responds to an error. 
                  The destination or the location may be a servlet or JSP page.
          o Different type of error a Servlet we need to throw:
               1.  ServletException
               2.  IOException
               3.  RuntimeException
               4.  Other exception that needs servletException to wrap it up.

        • DDL and DML sql statements:
            o Data definition language—used to manipulate the structure of the database.
            o Data manipulation language—used to manipulate the data in the database.
        • HttpServlet
            - handles and generates HTTP responses that are in web containers. There are many “application 
            server” where servlet can be hosted, some examples of these are Apache Tomcat, Oracle GlassFish 
            etc. Use the service() method to call on HTTP request methods like doGet(), doPost(), doPut() etc. 
            Each of the doXXX() methods have two parameters, the HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse. 
            The HttpServletRequest is the request sent by the client to the server, on the other hand 
            HttpServletResponse is the reponse from the server sent back to the client.

	I.Injection Description:

Injection attacks, as declared by the Open Web Application Security Project or OWASP

to be the top 1 security risk, is a technique used by attackers to supply, insert or inject malicious and untrusted codes into a query that is processed by an interpreter which may allow attackers to read, alter and modify databases or even destroy and corrupt data it contains resulting in data loss, denial of service, data theft and even compromise a full system takeover making it one of the most dangerous type of attacks. These attacks are easy to notice and are commonly applied in LDAP, SQL, XML parsers and OS commands.

Prevention:

Injections are easy to spot and very simple to prevent. It is best to abstain access to interpreters as much as possible as we can use API that doesn’t use much of these. Dynamic queries should not be practiced. Prepared statements should be used especially one with parameterized queries since this helps by not having the query’s purpose to change even though an attack was inserted.

Real world example:

There is a telecommunications company in United Kingdom named TalkTalk UK. In 2015, the company became a victim of a SQL injection attack that resulted to a data breach and affected about 157,000 customers. This attack destroyed the reputation of the company and gained losses in their shares.

II.Broken Authentication Description:

Broken Authentication is a security risk that happens when the functions of an

application are not applied correctly meaning that login credentials such as passwords or keys are easily compromised and the application’s implementation flaws are exploited by assailants to gain unwarranted access.

Prevention:

Avoid shipping or deploying an application with its default credentials. Check the level of security of passwords by comparing it to a list of strong password examples. Record all failed login attempts and notify administrators to alert them of possible attacks.

Real world example:

Recently Facebook had an issue about failure to uncover million of user profiles that has been used by a third party. Since Facebook was a free service it can easily be accessed by anybody, collecting most of the personal data of the users are done by getting personal information of the users who post personal privacy, data mining, and even liking a post of something of that data.

III.Sensitive Data Exposure Description:

Sensitive data exposure occurs when an application's sensitive information lacks proper

protection leaving it vulnerable to attackers. Sensitive data includes banking information, health information, and passwords.

Prevention:

The first course of action in preventing exposure of sensitive data is assessing what data is considered sensitive in order to take the necessary measures to protect it. After identifying the sensitive data make sure that it is not stored in plain text by using encryption to convert it into an indiscernible message. Make use of the latest encryption algorithms to ensure its security and reliability. Also make sure that the data is encrypted while it is in transport or transmission to avoid it being compromised by an attacker.

Real world example:

Vk.com, the Russian version of Facebook, was victim to a data breach from 2016 in which 100 million passwords and the database it was stored in along with the full names and email addresses of the users were leaked. The site is supposedly the largest social networking site in Europe with users reaching up to 350 million. The data breach was perpetuated by a hacker named Peace who sold the dataset on a dark web marketplace for only 1 Bitcoin.


IV. XML External Entities Description:

It is a type of attack that parses the XML input of an application. An XML External Entity attack takes place when a weakly configured XML parser processes an XML input that contains a reference to an external entity. It causes denial of service, confidential data exposure, and other consequences.
 
Prevention: 

This attack can be prevented by using simple data formats, for example JSON, and avoid calibration of sensitive data. Also make sure to disable external entities DTD processing in the application's XML parsers. 


V. Broken Access Control Description:

Usually happens when an application's access controls are defective. This allows attackers to take control of administrator functionalities and compromise sensitive data. Many web applications today are affected by this attack. 

Prevention: 

Utilize access control mechanisms only once and make constant use of them throughout the application. Record all access control failures and notify admins when necessary.


VI. Security Misconfiguration Description:

Security misconfigurations are typically holes left by developers or system administrators in the security framework of an application. Any level of an application's stack can be affected including the database, web servers and custom code.

Prevention:

Security Misconfigurations can be prevented through implementing an automated process that tests the configurations' effectiveness and sending security headers to clients.


VII. Cross-Site Scripting Description:

A security risk that enables attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts into the web pages that other users see. 

Prevention:

Use frameworks that do not have XSS in their design. Avoid untrustworthy HTTP request data based on the output of the HTML such as the URL, CSS or JavaScript.


VIII. Insecure Deserialization Description:

Insecure Deserialization happens when an application's logic is abused by untrustworthy data and causes denial of service and execution of arbitrary code upon deserialization.

Prevention:

Make use of digital certificates to perform interity checks on all serialized objects in order to be protected from aggressive object creation.


IX. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities Description:

Vulnerabilities are common with every software and are exploited by attackers to compromise the security of a system. Applications with vulnerable components leave it subject to
major data loss and other data breaches.

Prevention:

Delete unutilized components and files. Monitor unmaintained components and avoid creating security patches for old versions.


X. Insufficient Logging and Monitoring Description:
 
A vulnerability in an application wherein the security-critical events aren't logged correctly and current happenings aren't being monitored by the system.

Prevention:

Generate logs in an easily understandable format for a centralized log management solutions. Implement effective monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activites in an opportune time.

Real world example:

A forum software project was hacked through its vulnerability. The internal source code repository that contains the succeeding version was wiped by the attackers. The source code was recoverable but due to the lack of 
logging and monitoring an even worse breach happened shortly. The software project was discontinued after this incident.
