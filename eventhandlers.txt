Event Handling

Capturing - Event handler occurs first in the outermost element or ancestor of the target element,
then going inside towards the target element.

Bubbling - Event handler occurs first in the target element first then on the outer elements towards
the outermost elmeent or ancestor.

Event Propagation Order(dom-compliant browsers)

2. at target 
3. bubbling phase
 
method 1 (inline html event attribute)

method 2 (pre-DOM L2)

method 3 (DOM L2 event registration)

method 4 (Microsoft-specific, non-standard, IEv6-v10)

method 1 registration explicitly in the call to the handler
function handler(obj){}

method 2 or 3 registration implicitly as the first argument off the event handler
function handler(){
var element = this;
}
