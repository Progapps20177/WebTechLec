		<h1>AJAX and Node.js Notes</h1>
		<h2>AJAX</h2>
			<p>Description: AJAX is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It can send and receive information in different data formats, such as HTML, JSON and others.
			Its best characteristic is being able to update a page without having to reload it. For server communication, AJAX makes use of the XMLHTTPRequest object.</p>
			<h3>4 Major Features:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Updates a page without reloading it.</li>
					<li>Request or receive data from a server after loading a page.</li>
					<li>Send data to a server while in the background.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>How AJAX works:</h3>
				<p>The browser loads the AJAX engine instead of a traditional web page. When the page has loaded, the engine continues running in the background while using JavaScript to
				communicate with the browser. Whenever the user interacts with the page like clicking on the page, a JavaScript call is sent to the AJAX engine so it is prepared to respond instantly.
				If additional data is required then the engine sends a request to the server through the XML while also updating the page.</p>
			<h3>AJAX functions and methods</h3>
				<h4>AJAX event methods</h4>
					<p>.ajaxComplete() - registers a handler to be called when AJAX requests complete.</p>
					<p>.ajaxError() - registers a handler to be called when AJAX requests complete with an error.</p>
					<p>.ajaxSend() - attaches a function to be executed before an AJAX request is sent.</p>
					<p>.ajaxStart() - registers a handler to be called when the first AJAX request begins.</p>
					<p>.ajaxStop() - registers a handler to be called when all AJAX requests have completed.</p>
					<p>.ajaxSuccess() - attaches a function to be executed whenever an AJAX request completes successfully.</p>
					<br>
				<p>jQuery.ajax() - performs an asynchronoues HTTP (AJAX) request.</p>
				<p>jQuery.ajaxPrefilter() - handles custom AJAX options or modify existing options before each request is sent and before they are processed by $.ajax().</p>
				<p>jQuery.ajaxSetup() - sets default values for future AJAX requests. Not recommended for use.</p>
				<p>jQuery.ajaxTransport() - creates an object that handles the actual transmission of AJAX data.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Node.js</h2>
			<p>Description: Node.js is a JavaScript run-time environment which uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it light and effective. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
			A non-blocking I/O basically means that multiple data requests can be initiated in parallel or independently.</p>
			<h3>HTTP</h3>
				<p>To use the HTTP server and client then use <b>require('http')</b>.</p>
				<h4>http.Agent methods</h4>
					<p>new Agent([options])</p>
					<p>agent.createConnection(options[,callback])</p>
					<p>agent.keepSocketAlive(socket)</p>
					<p>agent.reuseSocket(socket,request)</p>
					<p>agent.destroy()</p>
					<p>agent.freeSockets</p>
					<p>agent.getName(options)</p>
					<p>agent.maxFreeSockets</p>
					<p>agent.maxSockets</p>
					<p>agent.requests</p>
					<p>agent.sockets</p>
