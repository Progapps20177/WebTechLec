				HTTP Request Methods

				1. GET
					- This method is a request used to retrieve specified data or resource

				2. HEAD
					- This method is a request used to retrieve specified data or resource
						just like the GET method but it doesn't have response message body.

				3. POST
					-
					
				4. PUT
					- 

				5. 
					-
					
				6.
					-
					
				Common Method Properties
					1. Safe Methods
						- These are read-only methods such as GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE

					2. Idempotent Methods
						- These are single and multiple requests methods such as GET, HEAD,
							OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, and DELETE

					3. Cacheable Methods
						- These are used to store responses for future use such as GET, HEAD,
							and POST

				html - contains the structure and content of webpages.
					It is an application of a standard known as the Standard Generalized 
					Markup Language (SGML).
					Developed at CERN, IETF, W3C, and WHATWG.
					html elements and attribute values must all be in lowercase.

				XML - stands for extensible markup language. It was made to be self-descriptive
					meaning a developer can create their own elements in this language.

				SGML - it serves as a general standard for how to format and specify 
					tags in markup languages such as HTML and XML

				Ian Hickson - formed WHATWG and created the specification for HTML 5.

				HTML Living Standard - a continuously updated standard with new features added
                       by web developers at a rate that keeps it somewhat ahead
                       of implementations but not so much.
				
				Tim-Berners-Lee = lead developer of HTTP
				WWW - resources that an be accessed with the use of the internet
				URL - Uniform Resource Locator - unique identification of a web
				DNS - Domain Name System - where the resource is mapped
				https - secure transport of data
				General headers - connection,date,upgrade
				Request headers - from client
				response headers - from servers
				Hypermedia-it is used to link two documents.

                <br>
                <p>
				HTMLDIFF - illustrate the differences between the HTML5 specification 
					and HTML4 specification.
		   
				HTML5
					A. Document Structure
						1. DOCTYPE - first thing to be declared in an html document. Tells the browser the
							version of the written html page.

						2. root element - the root element is the html element in the document.
							head element - the element that contains the metadata and is placed between the html and body tags.
							metadata - means data about data. Examples of metadata tags include title, style, meta, link, base and script.
      
					B. Document Components
						1. DOCTYPE - The declaration of an html5 doctype is simply <!DOCTYPE html>
							html 4.0.1 - has several doctype declarations called Data Type Definitions. There are three types of data type definitions, namely strict,
								transitional and frameset.
								
							html 4.0.1 strict - contains every html element and attribute but lacks presentational elements such as font. It doesn't allow the use of
								framesets.
								
							html 4.0.1 transitional - contains every html element and attribute. Presentational elements are present in this definition but still 
                                doesn't allow framesets.
								
							html 4.0.1 frameset - similar to transitional while also allowing the use of framesets.

						2. Elements - consists of a beginning tag and end tag between them is the content.
							a. Tags - keywords that tell a web browser how a page will format and display the content.
							
							b. Content
								b1. Content Models - describe the contents of an element.
									example: Document Object Model Tree - structures the elements of an markup language document as a tree.
									
								b2. Void elements - these are elements that require no end tag.

						3. custom data attributes - also known as data-* attribute. This allows to store custom data solely on a private page or application.
    
						4. WAI-ARIA - more known as the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, provides a way for Web content to be more available to people with disabilities.
								- tags particular components with their role.
								
						5. Scalable Vector Graphics - they define vector-based graphics. They retain a very high quality even when zoomed in.

						Character entity references - A few examples in HTML are &, !, -, = and several others.
						
						Comments - comments are added to an html document using this syntax; <!-- Write your comments here -->
						
						HTML preprocessors - programs that take a data type then convert it to another. They notably take out the tedious task of having to 
							repetitively do the same tasks in html. Some popular examples of html preprocessors include Jade, HAML and Pug.
