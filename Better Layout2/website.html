				HTMLDIFF - illustrate the differences between the HTML5 specification<br> 
					and HTML4 specification.<br><br>
		   
				HTML5<br>
					A. Document Structure<br>
						1. DOCTYPE - first thing to be declared in an html document. Tells the browser the<br>
							version of the written html page.<br><br>

						2. root element - the root element is the html element in the document.<br>
							head element - the element that contains the metadata and is placed between the html and body tags.<br>
							metadata - means data about data. Examples of metadata tags include title, style, meta, link, base and script.<br><br>
      
					B. Document Components<br>
						1. DOCTYPE - The declaration of an html5 doctype is simply <!DOCTYPE html><br>
							html 4.0.1 - has several doctype declarations called Data Type Definitions. There are three types of data type definitions, namely strict,<br>
								transitional and frameset.<br><br>
								
							html 4.0.1 strict - contains every html element and attribute but lacks presentational elements such as font. It doesn't allow the use of<br>
								framesets.<br><br>
								
							html 4.0.1 transitional - contains every html element and attribute. Presentational elements are present in this definition but still<br> 
                                doesn't allow framesets.<br><br>
								
							html 4.0.1 frameset - similar to transitional while also allowing the use of framesets.<br><br>

						2. Elements - consists of a beginning tag and end tag between them is the content.<br>
							a. Tags - keywords that tell a web browser how a page will format and display the content.<br><br>
							
							b. Content<br>
								b1. Content Models - describe the contents of an element.<br>
									example: Document Object Model Tree - structures the elements of an markup language document as a tree.<br><br>
									
								b2. Void elements - these are elements that require no end tag.<br><br>

						3. custom data attributes - also known as data-* attribute. This allows to store custom data solely on a private page or application.<br>
    
						4. WAI-ARIA - more known as the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, provides a way for Web content to be more available to people with disabilities.<br>
								- tags particular components with their role.<br><br>
								
						5. Scalable Vector Graphics - they define vector-based graphics. They retain a very high quality even when zoomed in.<br><br>

						6. Character entity references - A few examples in HTML are &, !, -, = and several others.<br><br>
						
						7. Comments - comments are added to an html document using this syntax; <!-- Write your comments here -->
						
						HTML preprocessors - programs that take a data type then convert it to another. They notably take out the tedious task of having to<br>  
							repetitively do the same tasks in html. Some popular examples of html preprocessors include Jade, HAML and Pug.
